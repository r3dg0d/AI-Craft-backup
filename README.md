"""
This project is a demo of allowing AI neural agents from virtual machines or vps-servers to roam minecraft
and craft, build, etc. for x amount of time.
"""

Use of minedojo for neural agents in minecraft, as well as main menu navigation and AI key-text entry

gameplay = "Connect to {"Server IP"} and play for 10 hours"

# AICraft Front-end server / VPS / Cloud Compute

Use of minecraft alt accounts via the-altening api for large-scale AI Training, or cloud AI Training with vps-servers & Cloud computing

Use of ZeroDay client for AI Neural-agents using cheats and easy keymappings

Requires manual config of each VPS agent

# Manual AI Agent Recording

Using OBS and AIvnc servers to automatically record interesting snippets of twitch livestreams

# Pricing & Powerhorse:

Manual VPS?

Will need cheap computer power, specifically graphical power.
Will also need these computers located in the cloud.

import cloud compute?
import vnc-server

Est Pricing for startup: ~= $1k? for 10 neural mc bots?
Due to computers and graphical power being so expensive, this project is kind of dead.

Quantum Computing or cluster computing possible?
